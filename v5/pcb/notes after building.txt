PROBLEMS WITH V5:
midi input causes buzz
	- 470uF decoupler on opto?
something not quite right about audio output, too bright? check
power LED not connected to, well, power
no labels for ICs
LEDs still slightly too bright?
labels for battery pos/neg DONE
silkscreen guide for led mounting

SOLUTIONS!
C3 and C7 were switched
1000uF cap on opto power largely solves noise
could also try 470uF on opto AND amp AND maybe atmega
