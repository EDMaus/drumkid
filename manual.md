# DrumKid manual
## Introduction
Welcome to the DrumKid manual! To get started with DrumKid, unscrew the six screws on the back of the unit, and carefully remove the back plate. Insert two AA batteries, replace the back plate, and tighten the screws. Slide the power switch to “on” - you should see the lights flash briefly. After this, DrumKid is ready to use.
## Philosophy
DrumKid is designed around a very basic computer chip with limited memory and processing power. My idea was to squeeze as much cool sound out of this chip as possible, but it has its limits. Rather than try and hide from these limits, I decided to embrace them. This means that it is absolutely possible to make horrible, distorted, broken noises using DrumKid. Some of these horrible noises will sound cool, others will not. DrumKid is a playable instrument like any other - experiment with it and see what happens.
## Basics
DrumKid has six buttons (A, B, and C on the left, X, Y, and Z on the right) and four knobs. The basic functions are as follows:
 - Press button Z to start or stop the rhythm
 - Press buttons A/B/C/X/Y to select different knob functions (see table below)
 - Turn any of the four knobs to alter the parameters in the current selected group (see table below)
 - Tap button A repeatedly to set the tempo
 - Press buttons B+C together to load a session, then choose which session to load by pressing any of the buttons
 - Press buttons X+Y together to save a session, then choose which slot to save your session in by pressing any of the buttons
 - Press buttons C+X together to reset all parameters to their defaults (this will not overwrite any sessions you have saved)
## Parameters
There are 20 different parameters which can be adjusted on DrumKid, split into five groups, with each group’s four parameters controlled by the four knobs. The parameters are grouped as follows:

### Group A
 1. Chance
 2. Zoom
 3. Range
 4. Midpoint
### Group B
 1. Pitch
 2. Crush
 3. Crop
 4. Glitch
### Group C
 1. Slop
 2. Swing
 3. Delay Time
 4. Delay Mix
### Group X
 1. Beat
 2. Tempo
 3. Time signature
 4. Drift
### Group Y
 1. Drop
 2. Drone modulation
 3. Drone mix
 4. Drone pitch

You can try out each parameter by starting a rhythm (using the Z button), then selecting a group and turning the different knobs. For example, try selecting group B (by pressing the B button) then turning the first knob, which will now control “pitch”. You should hear the sound change. Below are descriptions of exactly what each parameter does, and how it can be used.

**Chance** - The probability of extra drum hits being generated. At zero, the beat will be completely unchanged, while for higher values there will be lots of extra hits, creating a busier, messier beat. This can be used in conjuction with zoom, midpoint, and range to create drum fills that transition organically from a simple beat.

**Zoom** - Chooses which subdivision of the beat should be affected by the randomly generated extra hits. When zoom is at zero, beats will only be generated for “whole notes” (i.e. the first beat of the bar). Higher values will affect half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, and so on. A medium value is a good place to start for zoom, but turning it up can make a beat or fill sound more “urgent”.

**Range** - This is the range of velocities which will be assigned to the random hits. For all the random hits to have the same velocity as each other, keep this value at zero. For a wide range of velocities, turn this up high.

**Midpoint** - This is
