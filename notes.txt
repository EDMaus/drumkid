these notes are just for my reference really but feel free to read them!

------------

start with three basic sounds, kick/snare/hat
controls from previous drumkid:
tempo -> yes
blend -> yes but cycle through all patterns
hyperactivity -> yes
zoom -> yes
sloppiness -> yes?
toms -> hmmmm no?
percussion -> hmmm probs no?
pitch -> hopefully
ceiling -> probably
kick -> no?
snare -> no? or crossfade with kick/hats somehow?
resonance/cutoff -> combine somehow?
delay time/level -> nah, not enough processing power
volume -> analog knob i guess
