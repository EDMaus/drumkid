# DrumKid
## Lo-fi Arduino drum machine

### Concept
A drum machine which generates rhythms using probability. Based on a Javascript drum machine I made which was used extensively on my band's first album https://robotswans.bandcamp.com/album/the-tyranny-of-robot-swans

### Ingredients
The final version of this project will hopefully consist of a 3D-printed, GameBoy-style case with various buttons and knobs. Inside the case will be a PCB, with an Arduino-ish circuit generating audio using the Mozzi library.
