# DrumKid
## Lo-fi aleatoric Arduino drum machine

### Concept
A drum machine which generates rhythms using probability. Imagine a traditional step-based drum machine, but where various dice are rolled for each step, with the resulting numbers used to determine the behaviour of the beat.

### Setup
DrumKid is based around an Arduino, and coded using the Arduino IDE. Audio is produced by the Mozzi library. You can build a version of DrumKid using an Arduino, a breadboard, and standard electronic components, or you can build/buy the "full" version described below.

### Design
DrumKid is a portable, handheld, battery-powered instrument with a minimalist design. It consists of a PCB (printed circuit board) for the front panel, featuring knobs, buttons, LEDs, a power switch and a headphone/line output. The electronics are protected by two laser-cut pieces.

### Open Source
This project is fully open source. The code, breadboard layout, schematics, Gerber (PCB) files, and laser-cutter files are all included in the repository, with the aim of making this project easy to duplicate and adapt.
