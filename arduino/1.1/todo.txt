- more comments in code
+ read sync stop signal
+ don't change tempo on load while already playing
+ tap tempo goes weird at high tempos
- don't switch to group A when loading a beat (or group C when saving, etc)
- investigate memory issue; possible wiping of all beats?
+ add more time signatures, especially 3/4
+ add random time signature
+ with "drop" function, middle setting should be no muting, both ends should be silent, switch left-right (kick on left)
+ make it easier to change output channels
+ make it easier to change note mapping
+ add an optional clap
- generate random session
- update manual with new features
- include hackers' manual in regular manual
- make it easier to load custom samples
- MIDI in (drums, drone, knob CC?)
+ update default beat for new params
+ update qc random beats for new params
- had to reduce control rate to 128, 256 would be better (better float maths? less faffing with random time signature?)
- MIDI clock continue
- bigger dead zone for drone and drone mod
- reset function
- adjust note/channel mapping from drumkid directly
- don't lock up when no longer using MIDI clock
- only hold drone until stop button released
