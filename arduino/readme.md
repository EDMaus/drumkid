# DrumKid Arduino code

While developing DrumKid, each new PCB version pretty much required its own new version of the code. Now that the project is nearing completion, I've reorganised the code as follows:

0.4 - this was the code for the V4 PCB
0.5 - this was the code for the V5 PCB
1.0 - this is the code for the V6 onwards

Unless you've got an old version of DrumKid, you should just refer to the latest version.
