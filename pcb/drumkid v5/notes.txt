Things to add/change in V5 PCB:
- actually ground amp properly DONE
- less weird power switch
- don't make all knobs backwards DONE
- silkscreen button info? save, load, tap, start/stop?
- white space (silkscreen) for serial number
- component values visible on silkscreen
- more logical component layout to prevent routing nightmares
- MIDI output space?
- PCB battery snaps?
- enclosed case?
- capacitors tucked away somehow
- power LED?
- bigger mounting holes for pots
- insanely bright LEDs
