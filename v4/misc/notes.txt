these notes are just for my reference really but feel free to read them!

------------

start with three basic sounds, kick/snare/hat
controls from previous drumkid:
tempo -> yes
blend -> yes but cycle through all patterns
hyperactivity -> yes
zoom -> yes
sloppiness -> yes?
toms -> hmmmm no?
percussion -> hmmm probs no?
pitch -> hopefully
ceiling -> probably
kick -> no?
snare -> no? or crossfade with kick/hats somehow?
resonance/cutoff -> combine somehow?
delay time/level -> nah, not enough processing power
volume -> analog knob i guess

use EEPROM to save settings!
BUT, can only write to EEPROM ~10,000 times (per address?)
512 bytes of EEPROM, maybe store 40 bytes of data
with address cycling could write 100,000 times?
that would be fine if only stored beat on power off (30 years, 10 power cycles per day!)
could save every ten seconds (naively, 700 hours total run time, more if sensible), but EEPROM saving likely to disrupt audio out?
could save with a button, quick and dirty solution, maybe fine?
otherwise need to save on power off, bit of a headache, need to keep arduino on for maybe 200ms or so, surely not beyond the realm of possibility?
a capacitor might do the job - rough calculations say i might need 10,000uF or more, about £1.
other option is like a mosfet or something?
